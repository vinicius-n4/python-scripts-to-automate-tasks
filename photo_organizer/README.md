# photo_organizer

Script that I've made to sort photos by year and month.

## Usage
1. Install Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Open CMD on Windows, and type: 
- the language that we will use "python", 
- the path where the script is, 
- the path where the images are. 

3. Use quotes to refer the paths.
```bash
python3 photo_organizer.py "C:\user\home\Images"
```
